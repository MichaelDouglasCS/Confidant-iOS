# Confidant-iOS 

Confidant is an application used as my undergraduate thesis, that works as a social network of support, being a way to connect via chat people who need support with people who are available to help anonymously, reliably, thus making a pleasant experience leaving the user more receptive to seek a professional help in the future ❤️.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software.

```
1 - Xcode 8
2 - Swift 3
3 - CocoaPods
```

### Installing

Firs of all, you need install the Xcode 8, you can find it in the App Store.

```
https://developer.apple.com/xcode/
```

After you must install the CocoaPods.

CocoaPods is built with Ruby and it will be installable with the default Ruby available on macOS. You can use a Ruby Version manager, however we recommend that you use the standard Ruby available on macOS unless you know what you're doing.

Using the default Ruby install will require you to use sudo when installing gems. (This is only an issue for the duration of the gem installation, though.)

```
$ sudo gem install cocoapods
```

Lastly you need open the Terminal, go to Project root folder, and run this code:

```
$ pod install
```

Now you have all elements to run this project

## Running the tests

To execute the Tests, you need to press:

```
 command + U
```
